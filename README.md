# SpigotCraft
Make a server!

Server
-----
play.spigotmc.org

Rules
-----
* Do not submit content which you do not hold a license for.
* Be nice
* Use :+1: reactions for additions you support, and :-1: reactions for additions you don't. They will be pulled or closed when we feel like it based on these votes.
* Feel free to change groups, permissions, etc, but do not add yourself to them, this will be handled by the server operators.
* Plugins that require NMS won't work since the server will be running snapshots.

Recommended Setup
-----------------
* Clone this repo
* symlink the plugins dir into your test server: `ln -s SpigotCraft/plugins .`
