worlds:
  # Worlds can be handled by templates, based on world type
  # You can override the properties of the template by specifying them in this section
  #    for example 'Title: "My Awesome World"'
  #- name: world
  #  title: "World"
  #   Use 'enabled: false' to disable a certain world.
  #  enabled: false
  #   Use sendposition: false to prevent player positions from showing when on this world (if sendposition is globally enabled)
  #  sendposition: false
  #   Use sendhealth: false ot prevent player health from showing when on this world (if sendhealth is globally enabled)
  #  sendhealth: false
  #  # If world isn't contiguous chunks (due to teleporting, for example), fullrender needs to be given other locations to scan for tiles on each patch of chunks
  #  fullrenderlocations:
  #    - x: 10000
  #      y: 64
  #      z: 20000
  #    - x: -15000
  #      y: 64
  #      z: -5000
  #  # Use visibilitylimits to restrict which areas of maps on your world to render (zero or more shapes can be defined)
  #  # For a rectangle, the area is defined by x0, z0 to x1, z1
  #  # For a circle, the area is defined by a center at x,z with a radius 'r'
  #  visibilitylimits:
  #    - x0: -1000
  #      z0: -1000
  #      x1: 1000
  #      z1: 1000
  #    - x: -2000
  #      z: -1000
  #      r: 200
  #  # Use hiddenlimits to specifically hide portions of your world (the opposite of visibilitylimits)
  #  # For a rectangle, the area is defined by x0, z0 to x1, z1
  #  # For a circle, the area is defined by a center at x,z with a radius 'r'
  #  hiddenlimits:
  #    - x0: 100
  #      z0: 0
  #      x1: 200
  #      z1: 0
  #    - x: -2000
  #      z: -1000
  #      r: 200
  #  # Use hidestyle to control how hidden-but-existing chunks are to be rendered (air=empty air (same as ungenerated), stone=a flat stone plain, ocean=a flat ocean)
  #  hidestyle: stone
  #   Use 'template: mycustomtemplate' to use the properties specified in the template 'mycustomtemplate' to this world. Default it is set to the environment-name (normal or nether).
  #  template: mycustomtemplate
  #   Rest of comes from template - uncomment to tailor for world specifically
  #  # World center - default is spawn point
  #  center:
  #    x: 0
  #    y: 64
  #    z: 0
  #  # If bigworld set to true, use alternate directory layout better suited to large worlds
  #  bigworld: true
  #  # Number of extra zoom-out levels for world (each level is twice as big as the previous one)
  #  extrazoomout: 3
  #  # Default delay on processing of updated tiles, in seconds.  This can reduce potentially expensive re-rendering
  #  # of frequently updated tiles (such as due to machines, pistons, quarries or other automation).  Value can also be set on
  #  # individual maps.
  #  tileupdatedelay: 30
